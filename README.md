# SER 2022 `tlverse` Workshops [![Booklet](https://github.com/tlverse/ser2022-workshop/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tlverse/ser2022-workshop/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tlverse/ser2022-workshop/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for two half-day workshops on causal
inference and Targeted Learning with the `tlverse` software ecosystem. This
repository contains the full set of lesson materials for both workshops, 
offered at the [2022 Society for Epidemiologic Research Meeting](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2022-meeting/2022-workshops/). These teaching
materials are adapted from a draft of the forthcoming book [*Targeted Learning
in `R`: Causal Data Science with the `tlverse` Software
Ecosystem*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/), by Mark van der Laan, Jeremy
Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, Rachael Phillips, and Alan Hubbard. The
unabridged book is [freely available](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook); its
source materials may be found in the corresponding public [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook).

The workshop materials are automatically built and deployed using
[Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which supports using R and
RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific snapshot on
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility). An RStudio
session, pre-loaded with all the materials, is available via the "launch binder"
button at the top of this page.
